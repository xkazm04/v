  "conclusion": "The Israel-Iran conflict evolved from covert operations and proxy warfare into direct military confrontation, driven by Israel's determination to prevent Iranian nuclear weapons capability and Iran's regional ambitions. The conflict exposed how intelligence operations, assassinations, and nuclear proliferation fears can escalate into open warfare with massive human and economic costs.",
