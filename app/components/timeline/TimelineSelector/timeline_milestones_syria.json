  "summary": "These false statements were particularly damaging because they:\n\n**Enabled Mass Atrocities:** Assad's chemical weapons denials allowed continued attacks killing thousands while avoiding international intervention. Obama's failed red line encouraged further chemical weapons use by demonstrating lack of consequences.\n\n**Prolonged Conflict:** False promises of moderate support (Obama), humanitarian justifications for military operations (Turkey/Russia), and denial of expansionist agendas (Iran) prevented realistic peace negotiations based on actual motivations and capabilities.\n\n**Undermined International Law:** Systematic false narratives about targeting only terrorists while bombing civilians (Russia/Assad) and protecting shrines while conducting demographic engineering (Iran) normalized war crimes and weakened international humanitarian law.\n\n**Fueled Extremism:** ISIS's false religious legitimacy claims attracted tens of thousands of foreign fighters who committed atrocities across multiple continents. The group's territorial claims legitimized other extremist movements globally.\n\n**Destroyed Public Trust:** Repeated false statements by major powers undermined credibility of international institutions, peace processes, and humanitarian interventions, making future conflict resolution more difficult.\n\n**Prevented Accountability:** Denial of chemical weapons use, systematic torture, and civilian targeting prevented international justice mechanisms from functioning, ensuring continued impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThese deceptions collectively enabled one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history, with over 580,000 deaths and 13+ million displaced people."
