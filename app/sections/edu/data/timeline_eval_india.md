## Key Findings:

Arms Race Dynamics: Both countries engaged in massive weapons acquisitions from competing global powers (US/Israel/France for India vs China/Turkey for Pakistan), creating an action-reaction cycle that made conflict more likely.
Diplomatic Collapse: The systematic breakdown of all peaceful resolution mechanisms - from trade to water treaties to diplomatic channels - eliminated crisis management capabilities.
Great Power Competition: The conflict was significantly shaped by broader US-China rivalry, with each superpower arming their regional allies and using them as proxies.
Economic Warfare: Both sides weaponized trade, water rights, and economic relationships as tools of coercion before resorting to military force.

Critical Timeline Elements:

Trump's Return (Jan 2025): Dramatically shifted US policy toward India while Pakistan sought Chinese protection
Arms Race Acceleration (Feb 2025): Massive weapons acquisitions by both sides using foreign suppliers
Diplomatic Breakdown (Mar 2025): Complete collapse of peaceful resolution mechanisms
Kashmir Escalation (Apr 2025): Violence reached breaking point, setting stage for the terrorist attack

The timeline exposes how multiple actors - defense contractors, political leaders, foreign powers, and intelligence agencies - had various incentives to escalate rather than de-escalate tensions, making the eventual Pahalgam attack and subsequent war almost inevitable rather than a sudden surprise.
Would you like me to extend this timeline to include the actual conflict period (May 2025) or focus on any particular aspect in more detail?

## Statements
  These false statements were particularly damaging because they prevented accurate assessment of the conflict, misled domestic and international audiences, and hindered proper crisis management. Political leaders exaggerated victories and minimized losses to maintain domestic support, while Trump's mediation claims created diplomatic tensions between allies. The misinformation campaign made it difficult to establish facts necessary for preventing future conflicts and created competing narratives that continue to poison India-Pakistan relations. Most critically, the false statements about military capabilities, casualties, and diplomatic agreements undermined trust between the nuclear-armed neighbors and made peaceful resolution more difficult by locking leaders into public positions they could not retreat from without appearing weak.
