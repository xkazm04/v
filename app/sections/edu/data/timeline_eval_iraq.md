## Statements
Key Patterns in the False Statements:
- George W. Bush - Made definitive claims about WMD existence, Iraq-Al Qaeda connections, and premature victory declarations that proved completely false.
- Dick Cheney - Expressed "absolute certainty" about Iraqi weapons and nuclear programs while making wildly inaccurate predictions about being "greeted as liberators."
- Colin Powell - Assured the UN that his presentation contained "solid intelligence" and "facts, not conjecture" when it was largely based on fabricated or misinterpreted information.
- Donald Rumsfeld - Claimed to know exact WMD locations, made grossly inaccurate war duration predictions, and dismissed post-invasion chaos with "stuff happens."
- Condoleezza Rice - Used fear-based rhetoric like "mushroom cloud" warnings and claimed aluminum tubes were nuclear evidence when they were conventional rocket parts.

What Makes These Statements Particularly Damaging:
- Certainty Language - Using phrases like "no doubt," "absolute certainty," and "we know" when evidence was thin or contradictory
- Fear Appeals - Invoking 9/11 trauma and nuclear threats to justify predetermined policies
- Intelligence Misrepresentation - Presenting speculation and worst-case scenarios as established facts
- Post-Hoc Denials - Later claiming to be victims of "intelligence failures" rather than acknowledging selective use of evidence
