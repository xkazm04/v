  "timeSpan": "January 2025 - April 2025",
  "consequences": "**Strategic Buildup Costs:**\n- **Indian Defense Spending:** $76+ billion annual budget increase\n- **Pakistani Military Debt:** $12+ billion borrowed for Chinese weapons\n- **US Arms Sales:** $8.5 billion to India (F-16 modernization, S-400 systems)\n- **Chinese Military Aid:** $4.2 billion in weapons systems to Pakistan\n\n**Regional Tensions:**\n- **Kashmir Incidents:** 47 ceasefire violations in Q1 2025\n- **Cross-Border Infiltration:** 23 documented attempts\n- **Trade Disruption:** $2.1 billion annual trade at risk\n- **Diplomatic Breakdown:** All bilateral talks suspended\n\n**Economic Warfare:**\n- **Water Treaty Violations:** 14 technical disputes unresolved\n- **Most Favored Nation Status:** Revoked by both countries\n- **Investment Freezes:** $890 million in cross-border projects halted\n- **Defense Contractor Profits:** Israeli, French, Turkish, Chinese firms gained $15+ billion in orders",
  "conclusion": "The 2025 India-Pakistan conflict was not a sudden eruption but the inevitable result of escalating tensions, arms race dynamics, and systematic diplomatic failures throughout early 2025. Both nations' pursuit of military superiority through foreign partnerships created a powder keg that only needed a spark to explode into the most dangerous South Asian crisis in decades.",
